This project is a Proof Of Concept to Bweez company

Here is the NodeJS Backend.

Clone the repository

Install:
npm install

Start the application:
npm start

The api link to the server from React Frontend is now:
http://localhost:4000/upload-image

Install the frontend:

It's done !!

Now you can use your app (frontend):

- Click on the QRC Code
- Here is your webcam
- click on 'Capturez la photo' to capture image
- now the image is sent to the backend and is saved in a atlas mongodb cloud

Thank you !!
